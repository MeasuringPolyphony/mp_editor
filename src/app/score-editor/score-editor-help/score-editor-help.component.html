<h2>About the Score Editor</h2>
<p>
    The <strong>Score Editor</strong> is for making simple edits
    in order to align the parts in your score. In other words,
    if you made mistakes in your initial entry of the music on
    the previous screen (the <strong>Music Input</strong> screen)
    the score will not align properly and you may need to make adjustments
    to the note durations or add dots in order to get the proper alignment.

<h2>Making Simple Edits</h2>
<p>
    When you click on a pitch, the staff to which
    that pitch belongs will be highlighted with a
    dashed box in the manuscript image in the left
    of the screen. This is to help you check
    the accuracy of the edits you make.
</p>
<p>
    You can make simple edits directly as follows.
    By clicking on a pitch to highlight it you can edit:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Pitch: </strong>
        Use up/down arrow keys to change pitch.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Rhythm: </strong>
        Type a number key to alter its rhythm
        (1 semibreve, 2 minim, 4 semiminim,
        8 fusa, 6 semifusa, 0 breve, 9 long, 7 maxima).
        Scoring-up will rerun after a rhythmic value changes.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Dots: </strong>
        Typing a period will add or remove the dot from the
        highlighted pitch. Scoring-up will automatically
        rerun.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Accidentals: </strong>
        To add a flat, press <code>-</code>.
        To add a sharp, press <code>#</code>.
        To add a natural, press <code>n</code>.
        To clear accidentals, press <code>N</code>.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Cloning and Deleting Elements: </strong>
        Elements can be cloned by selecting one and pressing the
        <code>I</code> key. Elements can be deleted by pressing
        <code>Backspace</code>.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    You can also use the "Return to Music Input" button to return
    to the <strong>Music Input</strong> screen
    and make more significant edits, but any changes made
    in the <strong>Score Editor</strong> thus far will be lost!

<h2>Moving to Editorial Mode</h2>
<p>
    When making corrections in the <strong>Score Editor</strong>
    it is assumed that you are correcting mistakes <em>you</em>
    made, and both the MEI Parts and MEI Score files will be updated
    with these changes. However, once you move to <strong>Editorial Mode</strong>,
    the MEI Parts file will no longer be updated since this is a record
    of the music <em>exactly</em> as it was recorded in the original
    manuscript. Any further corrections made in <strong>Editorial
    Mode</strong> will be encoded in the MEI Score file as
    <strong>editorial</strong> corrections. For example, when a
    dot is added in <strong>Editorial Mode</strong>:
</p>
<pre><code>
    &lt;choice&gt;
        &lt;corr&gt;
            &lt;note dur=&quot;semibrevis&quot; oct=&quot;3&quot; pname=&quot;a&quot; dur.quality=&quot;minor&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;dot form=&quot;div&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/corr&gt;
        &lt;sic&gt;
            &lt;note dur=&quot;semibrevis&quot; oct=&quot;3&quot; pname=&quot;a&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/sic&gt;
    &lt;/choice&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>
    The purpose of the <strong>Score Editor</strong> is to do enough editing to
    enable the correct alignment of the score and edit while
    viewing the manuscript. For more fine-grained editing,
    it is recommended to download the MEI file and open it
    in a tool that allows direct editing of the MEI file such
    as <a href="https://verovio.humdrum.org" target="_blank">
    the Verovio Humdrum Viewer</a> or <a href="https://editor.verovio.org"
    target="_blank">the Verovio Editor</a>.
